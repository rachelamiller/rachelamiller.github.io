    "section": "",
    "text": "The Vancouver Canucks have seen a lot of injury this season. One of whom being their captain Quinn Hughes. Hughes was named the 15th captain for the Canucks in September 2023, the first defenseman to have a ‘C’ on their sweater since a three-player rotation in the 1990-91 season with Doug Lidster, Trevor Linden and Dan Quinn.\nNo. 43, Quinn Hughes has been dealing with an Oblique strain, a lower body injury and other unspecified ailments. Due to his injuries through out this season he has missed a number of games including the Four Nations Face-Off Tournament. After sitting out for the rest of their game against the Seattle Kraken, the oldest Hughes brother was back in the lineup to play against the Calgary Flames.\nAs of their most recent win against the Colorado Avalanche, April 10, 2025, Hughes is up to 74 points, 16 goals with 58 assists, in only 65 games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nhockey25 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/hockeylogs2025.csv\")\n\nteamstats &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Vancouver Canucks Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nname_pts &lt;- teamstats |&gt; \n  select(Name, PTS, GP)\n\nnhl &lt;- read_csv(\"data/NHL Summary - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nname_pts |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    GP = \"Games Played\", \n    PTS = \"Points\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who has the most points on the team in the games they have played? \", \n    subtitle = \"Hughes has the most points on the entire team, with the person behind him having played more games.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\",weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),  locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note( \n    source_note = md(\"**By:**Rachel Miller | **Source:** NHL: Vancouver Canucks Team Stats\" )\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#00205B\"), \n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ), \n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Q.

Hughes has played seven less games than Brock Boeser but has 24 more points than him.

Right after their come back win against the Dallas Stars Tuesday the eighth. Vancouver was down 5-2 late in the third period when they scored their three goals to tie it up with less than a minute in the third.\nWe already know that Hughes has the most points on the team. But who steps up in terms of points when he isn’t in the game?\n\n\nCode\nvk &lt;- nhl |&gt; filter(Player == \"Nikita Kucherov\") \nnk &lt;- nhl |&gt; filter(Player == \"Nathan MacKinnon\")\nqh &lt;- nhl |&gt; filter(Player == \"Quinn Hughes\")\nbb &lt;- nhl |&gt; filter(Player == \"Brock Boeser\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = nhl, aes(x=GP, y=PTS), color= \"lightgrey\") + \n   geom_point(data=vk, aes(x=GP, y=PTS), color=\"#002868\") +\n   geom_point(data=nk, aes(x=GP, y=PTS), color=\"#6F263D\") +\n   geom_point(data=qh, aes(x=GP, y=PTS), color=\"#00843D\") +\n   geom_point(data=bb, aes(x=GP, y=PTS), color=\"#00843D\") +\n  geom_text(data = vk, aes(x=74-.5, y=116+7, label = Player)) +\n  geom_text(data = nk, aes(x=79-4, y=116-11, label = Player)) +\n  geom_text(data = qh, aes(x=64-.5, y=74+7, label = Player)) +\n  geom_text(data = bb, aes(x=71-.5, y=49+7, label = Player)) +\n  labs(title = \"Who steps up in goal scoring when Quinn Hughes is not in the game?\", subtitle = \"Brock Boeser might step up, but Quinn Hughes is still leading the team in points\", x=\"Games Played\", y=\"Points\", caption = \"Source:Hockey Reference | By: Rachel Miller\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question would be Brock Beoser. With 49 points in 71 games, the Minnesota native is helping the team with his 25 goals this season.\nAlthough they have been eliminated from a spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, can the Captain improve his standings and possibly win another Norris Trophy for the second year in a row with the last two games the team has for the season?"

The last time they won both Cups was the 2002-03 season. Since then, the team has slowly gotten worse over time and missed the playoffs for several years. If they did make it to the playoffs, they usually fell out during the first or second rounds.\nWhat happened? Is there certain player(s) that are leading the team in points to get them back to the caliber they once were. Or are the teams in the USHL just not doing very well this season?\nI am going to look at the teams in the USHL in the 2002-03 season and the teams from this season to see what happened to get the Stars to win the Anderson Cup and hopefully to bring the Clark Cup back to the Ice Box.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nmasterushl &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Master USHL spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv\") \nmaster2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\") |&gt; filter(G &gt; 0) \nmaster2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\") |&gt; filter(G &gt; 0) \ngfvga2003 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Master USHL spreadsheet - Sheet2.csv\") |&gt; mutate(difference = GF - GA)\ngfvga2025 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Master USHL spreadsheet - Sheet3.csv\") |&gt; mutate(difference = GF - GA)\ncedarrapids2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Cedar Rapids\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\ncedarrapids2003 &lt;-masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\ndubuque &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"DBQ\")\nlincoln2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"LIN\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\") \nname2025 &lt;- lincoln2025 |&gt; top_n(1)\nlincoln2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"LIN\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\nname2003 &lt;- lincoln2003 |&gt; top_n(2)\nomaha2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"RC\" | Team == \"OMA\" ) |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\nomaha2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\ntricity2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tri City\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\ntricity2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\nwaterloo2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Waterloo\" | Team == \"WAT\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\nwaterloo2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\nchicago2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Chicago Steel\" | Team == \"CHI\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\nchicago2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\nfargo &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"FGO\")\nmadison &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Madison Caps\")\nsiouxcity2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Sioux City\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\nsiouxcity2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\nUSA &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"USAND\")\ndesmoines2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Des Moines\" | Team == \"DM\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\ndesmoines2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\ngreenbay2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"Greenbay\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\ngreenbay2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\nmuskegon &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"MUS\")\nyoungstown &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"YNG\")\nsiouxfalls2025 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Team == \"SF\") |&gt; filter(Year == \"2025\")\nsiouxfalls2003 &lt;- masterushl |&gt; filter(Year == \"2003\")\n\n\ndumb1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = gfvga2003, \n    aes(y= reorder(Team, difference), x=GF, xend=GA),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\", \n    colour_x = \"#001A70\",\n    colour_xend = \"#010101\"\n    ) + \n  labs(\n    y=\"\",\n    x=\"Goals For vs Goals Against in 2003\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\ndumb2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = gfvga2025,\n    aes(y= reorder(Team, difference), x=GF, xend = GA), size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\", \n    colour_x = \"#001A70\",\n    colour_xend = \"#010101\"\n  ) + \n   labs(\n    y=\"\",\n    x=\"Goals For vs Goals Against in 2025\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n dumb1 + dumb2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Stars had the best average goals for than goals against.\",\n    subtitle = \"If goals for is the on right that means the team did better at defending their own net.

Looking at the 2003 season, the team had two stand out players, Ryan Potulny and David Backes.\nRyan Potulny went on to be drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 2003. After three years in Philly he played for Edmonton, Chicago and finally Ottawa before becoming an assistant coach at the University of Minnesota.\nDavid Backes was also drafted in the 2003 draft by the Saint Louis Blues. After playing for the Blues for 10 years he was traded to Boston and finally Anaheim. On September 9,2021 Backes signed a one-day contract with the Blues to officially retire with his first team.\nWe know that Potulny and Backes were the team’s top scores, but how does the 2025 roster compare.\n\n\nCode\nscatter1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = master2003, aes(x= GP, y= Pts), color= \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = lincoln2003, aes(x= GP, y= Pts), color= \"#001A70\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = name2003, aes(x=GP, y=Pts, label = `Player Name`)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,20,40,60,80), limits = c(0,80)) + \n  labs(\n    x= \"Games Played in the 2003 Season\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nscatter2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = master2025, aes(x= GP, y= Pts), color= \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_point(data = lincoln2025, aes(x= GP, y= Pts), color= \"#001A70\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = name2025, aes(x=GP, y=Pts, label = `Player Name`)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,20,40,60,80), limits = c(0,80)) + \n  labs(\n    x= \"Games Played in the 2025 Season\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\nscatter1 + scatter2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Games played in 2003 vs 2025 in relation to points\",\n    subtitle = \"The top point scorer in 2025 would rank third in the 2003 roster.\", \n    caption = \"Source: USHL | By: Rachel Miller\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one player on this season’s team would compare to the 2003 roster. Even then Jack Pechar, an assistant captain, would only rank third in comparison to Potulny and Backes. Pechar has played in his last game with the stars after three years with the team. He will now go on to play for Northeastern University with his Captain Matthew Maltais, who from the graph above ranked eighth in goals and assists.\nUnfortunately the stars have ended their season against the Waterloo Blackhawks in a 3-1 series. Their last two games, both were away, they lost in a shut out, 5-0 and 2-0 respectively."
