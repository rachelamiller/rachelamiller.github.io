    "text": "The Vancouver Canucks have seen a lot of injury this season. One of whom being their captain Quinn Hughes. Hughes was named the 15th captain for the Canucks in September 2023, the first defenseman to have a ‘C’ on their sweater since a three-player rotation in the 1990-91 season with Doug Lidster, Trevor Linden and Dan Quinn.\nNo. 43, Quinn Hughes has been dealing with an Oblique strain, a lower body injury and other unspecified ailments. Due to his injuries through out this season he has missed a number of games including the Four Nations Face-Off Tournament. After sitting out for the rest of their game against the Seattle Kraken, the oldest Hughes brother was back in the lineup to play against the Calgary Flames.\nAs of their most recent win against the Colorado Avalanche, April 10, 2025, Hughes is up to 74 points, 16 goals with 58 assists, in only 65 games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nhockey25 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/hockeylogs2025.csv\")\n\nteamstats &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Vancouver Canucks Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nname_pts &lt;- teamstats |&gt; \n  select(Name, PTS, GP)\n\nnhl &lt;- read_csv(\"data/NHL Summary - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nname_pts |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    GP = \"Games Played\", \n    PTS = \"Points\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who has the most points on the team in the games they have played? \", \n    subtitle = \"IDK Yet\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\",weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),  locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note( \n    source_note = md(\"**By:**Rachel Miller | **Source:** NHL: Vancouver Canucks Team Stats\" )\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#00205B\"), \n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ), \n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Q.
